Meningitis may be difficult to diagnose as there may be nonspecific signs of a systemic illness with fever, irritability, drowsiness, vomiting, and convulsions. Stiff neck may be absent. A bulging fontanelle may be present and alert to an underlying meningitis. A high index of suspicion and liberal use of lumbar puncture are keys to early diagnosis. Diagnosis is confirmed by CSF examination, blood culture, and PCR. The spinal fluid usually shows an elevated pressure, a predominantly neutrophilic leukocytosis (usually 1000 \u2013 10 000 cells / ml) an elevated protein level, and a decreased glucose content. 15 \u2013 30 % of infants who survive meningitis show neurological sequelae, including blindness, deafness, and mental retardation.",

Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk.

In most described cases the disease will lead to death several weeks after the onset of symptoms. Lesions are typically characterised as non-purulent encephalitis. The incubation period is unknown but considered to last weeks to months. The etiologic viruses are restricted mainly to the central nervous system, absent in blood, and viral shedding by humans has not been documented. There is no evidence of natural person-to-person transmission, but iatrogenic transmission by solid organ transplantation is possible.",

Clinical features include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, meningismus, visual disturbances, abnormal mental status, seizures, and raised intracranial pressure. Headache, fever, and stiff neck may be absent. The diagnosis is made by microscopic examination of the spinal fluid, culture of CSF and blood, and the latex agglutination test to detect the capsular polysaccharide antigen in CSF and blood. The organism may be seen on Gram stain or India ink stain of the CSF. The spinal fluid usually shows varuable lymphocytic pleocytosis, a low glucose content, and a high protein level.",

Patients with intraspinal abscess present with variable degrees of paraparesis or quadriparesis, sensory impairment below the level of the lesion, altered sphincter function, and back pain.

The signs and symptoms are variable but typically present as an expanding mass lesion, over a variable period of time, with headache, fever, and a focal neurologic deficit. Seizures may occur. Diagnosis is made by neuroimaging. Microbiologic diagnosis is made by gram stain and culture of abscess material.",

Early signs typically include fever, hypotension, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous flushing or a skin rash. Later, patients may develop signs of progressive haemorrhagic diathesis, such as petechiae, mucous membrane and conjunctival haemorrhage, haematuria, hematemesis, and melena. Lethality may reach 30%. Transmission occurs via bites of infected ticks, by direct contact with infected animal blood, or iatrogenic transmission. Laboratory diagnosis of the infection during the acute phase of illness consists of detection of viral nucleic acid or by isolation of the virus or by demonstration of viral antigen by enzyme-linked immunoassay from serum or plasma samples. In samples collected later during the illness, diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of specific IgG and IgM antibodies.",

Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in pregnant women when infected. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period typically is 7\u201311 days (range \u22482\u201321 days).",

Spontaneous pain may be continuous or manifest in intermittent episodes. Pain evoked as an increased response to a painful stimulus (hyperalgesia) or painful response to a normally nonpainful stimulus (allodynia) is also common. Negative (e.g., decreased or loss of sensation) and positive sensory symptoms or signs (e.g., allodynia or hyperalgesia) must be compatible with the innervation territory of the affected cranial nerve or peripheral dermatome (or dermatomes).",

Confirmation is by identification of rubella virus in nasal swab, throat swab or blood samples, or by detection of rubella virus specific IgM antibodies. Its public health importance lies in its potential to cause devastating harm to the fetus of an infected mother (congenital rubella syndrome).",
